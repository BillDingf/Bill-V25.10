# Bill-V25.10
## Description: 
### What is this for?
This file is the changelogs and develops' plan of Bill. 
### Why create this?
I have lots of updates and new features every month, and I need more features to handle the mess of work and life for now and the future.But all these new releases and needs are too many to track without management. So I create this file for the file to track and indicate this chaos.
### What is the order of version number?
I will update it 1st day every month for the changes, updates, and new features of the last update. And the build plan for the next month or quarter as well.
So the first part of the number is my age, the second part is the month of this year. Although it is a little bit strange, I don't have new thoughts now.
### Why English?
My English is getting worse now due to the lack of use. But I may need to use it for future work, which is part of my ability need to move up. So even though I have difficulties using English to write it down, I insist on using it. The difficulty always brings high quality joys.
### Why Github?
I saw my humman body including the brain as my product, and my mind is the PM of this product. So as a PM, using Github for release not is the best.
